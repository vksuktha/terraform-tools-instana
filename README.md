# terraform-tools-instana

The script in this repository creates a Resource group, VPC, Subnet, Public Gateway and VM (Virtual Server Instance) with essential security groups, required for Instana installation in the target IBM Cloud account and subnet and installs Instana in it.

## Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/vksuktha/terraform-tools-instana.git
```
## Generate SSH key 
Instana VM requires an SSH Key, so run the following command to generate it:

```
cd terraform-tools-instana
chmod 755 create-ssh-keys.sh
./create-ssh-keys.sh
```
Public and private ssh key pair files (`ssh-instana.pub` and `ssh-instana`) gets generated in the project directory.

## Provide variable values
Rename the variable template file `terraform.tfvars.tmpl` to `terraform.tfvars` file and assign values to all variables.
```
cp terraform.tfvars.tmpl terraform.tfvars
```
Then edit the `terraform.tfvars` file to define the following keys:
```
ibmcloud_api_key=""                             # IBM Cloud Account API Key
RESOURCE_PREFIX="instana"                       # Prefix value which will be added to all resources
region="us-south"                               # IBM Cloud region 
zone="us-sount-1"                               # IBM Cloud zone
sales_id="xxxx"                                 # Instana license sales_id
agent_key="xxxxxxxx"                            # Instana license agent_key
name="instana-vm"                               # The name for instana VM to be created"
ssh_instana_public_key_file="ssh-instana.pub"   # SSH PUBLIC KEY file path
ssh_instana_private_key_file="ssh-instana"      # SSH PRIVARTE KEY file path
```

## Module details
The module being used in this code is available at https://github.com/vksuktha/instana-terraform-scripts and example usage is as follows:
```
module "instana_instance" {
  source = "github.com/vksuktha/instana-terraform-scripts?ref=v1.0.2"

  name                 = var.name
  RESOURCE_PREFIX      = var.RESOURCE_PREFIX
  ibmcloud_api_key     = var.ibmcloud_api_key
  region               = var.region
  zone                 = var.zone
  sales_id             = var.sales_id
  agent_key            = var.agent_key
  ssh_instana_public_key_file = var.ssh_instana_public_key_file
  ssh_instana_private_key_file = var.ssh_instana_private_key_file
}
```

## Install Instana
To create VM and install Instana execute following command:
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Instana credentials and IP address of the VM would be displayed after VM is provisioned and Instana setup is complete.

**Note**: The user of the provided API key, needs to have privileges to create resource-group, vpc, sunet, ssh-key and VSI instances and also IP-spoofing Operator. For enabling IP-Spoofing Operator privilege check `IAM prerequisites` section in this [blog](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/network-function-virtualization-nfv-using-vpc-routing)

## Access Instana

Instana can be accessed though the browser `https://<IP_Address>`. Credentials to access Instana can also be found in the VM at `/instana/instana_credentials.txt`

Instana VM can be accessed using the SSH private key file generated in the project directory earlier.
```
ssh -i ssh_instana root@<IP_Address>
```
